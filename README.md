 ### What is a Data Structures?
 Data structures are a collection of methods and patterns that organize, store, and manage data efficiently and effectively. These structures are widely used in computer science and programming.
 <br/><br/>
The most common data structures include :

1. Arrays : A collection of data elements arranged in a contiguous sequence, where each element has an index indicating its position.
2. Linked Lists : Data is stored as linked nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
3. Trees : A hierarchical structure consisting of nodes connected in a hierarchical manner. The main node is known as the root, and other nodes are considered as child nodes.
4. Queues : A data structure where data elements are stored in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) or LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) manner.
5. Graphs : A data structure composed of nodes that represent points and edges that represent relationships between data elements.
6. Stack : Data is stored in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner, and access is limited to the top element (the last one pushed in).
7. Hash Table : Data is mapped to a set of indices using a hash function, where these indices, called "keys," quickly retrieve the desired data.

<br/>
These structures each have their own characteristics and specific use cases, and are typically chosen based on the specific needs of programs and algorithms.
